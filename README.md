# siem-dashboard-1.0.0
New, cut-down dashboard after the old one broke.

Launch the application by running python siem_dashboard.py
The dashboard contains two main tabs:

Alert Dashboard: Shows current security alerts and statistics
Log Monitor: Displays and analyzes security logs


Use the "Load Sample Logs" button to view example security events
Monitor the statistics panel for overview of security alerts
Review individual alerts in the main alert view


This basic SIEM dashboard can be extended in several ways:

Add real log file monitoring
Implement custom alert rules
Add database integration for persistent storage - TD
Enhance the GUI - TD
Add network monitoring capabilities
Implement real-time threat intelligence feeds
