# SIEM Dashboard Documentation

## Overview

The SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) Dashboard is a React-based web application designed to visualize security metrics and alerts in real-time. It provides security professionals with a quick and intuitive way to monitor threat distributions and recent security events.

## Features

1. Real-time updates of security metrics
2. Visualization of threat distribution using a bar chart
3. Display of recent security alerts
4. Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 12.0 or higher)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/siem-dashboard.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd siem-dashboard
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the dashboard.

## Components

### SIEMDashboard

The main component that renders the entire dashboard. It includes:

#### Threat Distribution Chart

- Utilizes `recharts` library to create a bar chart
- Displays the distribution of different types of security threats
- Updates in real-time to show the latest threat landscape

#### Recent Alerts

- Shows a list of the most recent security alerts
- Updates dynamically as new alerts are generated

## Data Flow

1. The `generateData()` function simulates real-time data generation for the threat distribution chart.
2. The `useEffect` hook sets up an interval to update the chart data and potentially add new alerts every 5 seconds.
3. The state is updated using `setData()` and `setAlerts()`, which triggers a re-render of the component with the new data.

## Customization

### Integrating Real Data Sources

To integrate real data sources:

1. Replace the `generateData()` function with a call to your actual data API.
2. Modify the `useEffect` hook to fetch data at appropriate intervals or in response to specific events.
3. Ensure that the data structure matches the expected format for the chart and alerts.

### Adding New Visualizations

To add new visualizations:

1. Import additional chart types from the `recharts` library or other visualization libraries.
2. Create new state variables to hold the data for these visualizations.
3. Add new components or modify the existing `SIEMDashboard` component to include these visualizations.
4. Update the data fetching logic to include data for the new visualizations.

## Styling

The dashboard uses a combination of custom CSS and component libraries for styling:

- Tailwind CSS classes are used for layout and basic styling.
- The `@/components/ui/card` and `@/components/ui/alert` components are used for consistent UI elements.

To modify the styling:

1. Edit the Tailwind classes in the JSX to adjust layout and basic styles.
2. Modify the theme in your Tailwind configuration file to change global styles.
3. Create additional CSS modules or styled-components for more specific styling needs.

## Performance Considerations

- The dashboard updates every 5 seconds, which may impact performance on slower devices or with large datasets.
- Consider implementing pagination or limiting the number of displayed alerts for better performance with large datasets.
- Use React's `useMemo` or `useCallback` hooks to optimize expensive computations or callback functions if needed.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that any real data integration is done securely, using proper authentication and encryption.
- Be cautious about the information displayed on the dashboard, especially in production environments.
- Implement proper access controls to ensure that only authorized users can view the dashboard.

## Testing

To run tests:

```
npm test
```

(Note: Actual test files need to be created)

## Building for Production

To create a production build:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with optimized production-ready files.
